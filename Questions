QUESTIONS:
* Start Game --> a use case ? Or inculded in another use case ?
* Should there be a countdown for number of used blocks ?
* What if only one of both connectors connect ? Is that possible ? (Plug/socket ...)
* Between two groups of blocks horizontally and vertically (different extensions ?)
